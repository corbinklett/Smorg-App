1. Build phonegap project
2. Edit the config.xml file in the top level www folder as needed.
3. Make sure that www/index.html contains links to js/index.js and includes the app.initialize(); script.
4. May be smart to update version of angular.

The "if($cookies.user)" does not seem to work in PhoneGap.

Changed LoginCtrl

These changes will have to be transferred to phonegap_dev branch. (changes to config.xml and controllers.js and index.html)

Cookies become undefined after the login page.

Check on if "if (localStorageService.get(...)" even works. It does.
